      "Rhyhorns brain is very small. It is so dense, while on a run it forgets why it started running in the first place. It apparently remembers sometimes if it demolishes something.When flames drip from its nose, that means it has a cold. Have it lie down for a nice rest in some magma.It likes swimming around with people on its back. In the Alola region, its an important means of transportation over water. It throws bones at Mandibuzz to knock it down. Its thought that Marowak is trying to avenge its parent.In water, Mudkip breathes using the gills on its cheeks. If it is faced with a tight situation in battle, this Pokémon will unleash its amazing power—it can crush rocks bigger than itself.Wherever Slaking live, rings of over a yard in diameter appear in grassy fields. They are made by the Pokémon as it eats all the grass within reach while lying prone on the ground. Although its form changes with the weather, that is apparently the result of a chemical reaction and not the result of its own free will.Bulbasaur can be seen napping in bright sunlight. There is a seed on its back. By soaking up the suns rays, the seed grows progressively larger.The light from its tail can be seen from space. This is why you can always tell exactly where it is, which is why it usually keeps the light off.",
